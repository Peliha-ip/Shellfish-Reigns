Features:
- Oases generate in deserts
- Flowing water next to a pearl block and above sand generates krill blocks
- Crabs dance when jukeboxes are playing
- Eating raw shellfish could give the player poison 2 and nausea for 1 minute.
- Hermit crabs can equip bowls, armadillo scutes, hermit crab shells, any shellfish shell, bottles, hearts of the seas, nautilus shells, buckets, bundles, goat horns, and turtle scutes
- Squids now drop calamari upon death
- Glow squids now drop glow calamari upon death
- Crab claw extends block reach
- Lobster claw extends attack reach
- Combining a crab claw and a lobster claw with sticks gives the player the crustacean staff that extends both
- Perfume repels creepers, undead mobs, spiders, cave spiders, and silverfish
- Perfume attracts foxes, rabbits, cats, wolves, armadillos, axolotls, striders, bees, nautili, meerkats, whales, dolphins, pakiceti, sniffers, ocelots, seagulls, flamingos, harbor seals, and mantis shrimps
- Perfume is forbidden in the deep dark and ancient cities as they're an immediate trigger to the warden
- Pakiceti show interests towards whales and dolphins
- Cold ocean ruins can have pakicetus husks in suspicious gravel
- Seagulls would pick up some items like spider eyes or rotten flesh on beaches
- Flamingos can be dyed since they're white by default and turn pink when eating shrimp.
- Tropical slimes hang out in warm and lukewarm oceans and attack anything in the water. They get bigger the more they eat.
- Tropical slime blocks are technically water blocks with a biofilm. This means aquatic mobs and can live in tropical slime blocks and they can be used for negating fall damage without bouncing uncontrollably. Tropical slime blocks also keep corals alive.
- Touching a jellyfish will give the player poison for 30 seconds.
- Seals attack any fish or shellfish mobs.
- Great white sharks attack seals and turtles. They can attack players, but cues will show that it was an accidental attack (as sharks actually attack people because of misindentificatiom and let go when they realize their mistake).
- Every 5-10 minutes, great white sharks would drop a shark tooth.
- A whale that dies on the shore would create a violent explosion 5 minutes after death, however, the player has a 5 minutes countdown to shear the whale carcass before it explodes.
